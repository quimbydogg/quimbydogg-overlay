# quimbydogg-overlay
Personal overlay for packages not in official Gentoo repos or major overlays.  Might add ebuilds from other overlays if I only want one package from it for my system(s).  Learning how ebuilds and overlays work.  You probably don't want to use this.

To add with layman:

#layman -o https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quimbydogg/quimbydogg-overlay/master/quimbydogg.xml -f -a quimbydogg

There will be a warning when you sync overlays since this overlay is not part of the default overlay list used by layman.
