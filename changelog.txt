20200720 - Removed old mopidy/spotify ebuilds.  Not using anymore - no longer supported.

20200111 - Updated openrazer ebuild to account for renaming of razermug to razeraccessory.

20191231 - Added ebuild for pykka 1.2.1 that still supports python2_7 (this was removed from main Gentoo tree but necessary for mopidy-spotify from this ebuild)

20191114 - Bumped Genymotion-bin up to 3.0.3.

20181209 - Updated Polychromatic ebuild to include necessary less (nodejs) dependancy.

20181208 - Added openrazer (naga trinity test branch) and polychromatic ebuilds from vifino overlay.  
Updated manifest for latest BlackLight build of mopidy-spotify (this includes fixes for playlists/searching).

20180525 - Added mopidy-spotify ebuild 3.1.0-r1 which uses a BlackLight fork to fix a recent problem with playlists not displaying.  
The way playlist is fixed will impact/slow down mopidy.  Use at your own risk (works fine for me).  Mask if issues.  
Search also works in this build (feature did not work in Mrueg's overlay)
