20191214 - Updated openrazer ebuild.

20191114 - Bumped Genymotion-bin up to 3.0.3.

20191024 - Added Openrazer, Polychromatic, and node-js/less back.  Using Razer mouse again and Trinity Naga support merged into main Openrazer branch.

20191015 - Added Genymotion-bin ebuild that fixes libswscale.so.4 issue with main tree ebuild.  Removed Polychromatic, openrazer, less.  Not using these tools, no longer maintaining.

20181209 - Updated Polychromatic ebuild to include necessary less (nodejs) dependancy.

20181208 - Added openrazer (naga trinity test branch) and polychromatic ebuilds from vifino overlay.  
Updated manifest for latest BlackLight build of mopidy-spotify (this includes fixes for playlists/searching).

20180525 - Added mopidy-spotify ebuild 3.1.0-r1 which uses a BlackLight fork to fix a recent problem with playlists not displaying.  
The way playlist is fixed will impact/slow down mopidy.  Use at your own risk (works fine for me).  Mask if issues.  
Search also works in this build (feature did not work in Mrueg's overlay)
