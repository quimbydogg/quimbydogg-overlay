20181209 - Updated POlychromatic ebuild to include necessary less (nodejs) dependancy.

20181208 - Added openrazer (naga trinity test branch) and polychromatic ebuilds from vifino overlay.  
Updated manifest for latest BlackLight build of mopidy-spotify (this includes fixes for playlists/searching).

20180525 - Added mopidy-spotify ebuild 3.1.0-r1 which uses a BlackLight fork to fix a recent problem with playlists not displaying.  
The way playlist is fixed will impact/slow down mopidy.  Use at your own risk (works fine for me).  Mask if issues.  
Search also works in this build (feature did not work in Mrueg's overlay)
